## 🌾 Overview

Plant disease wipes out a staggering share of the world's crops every single year, and for small-scale farmers and home gardeners, catching an infection early is often the difference between a healthy harvest and a ruined one — yet professional diagnostic tools are usually too expensive or too slow to be practical.

**PlantEye** is our answer: a low-cost, autonomous four-wheeled rover that patrols a garden, uses computer vision to spot plants, photographs their leaves, and runs the image through a disease-classification model — all without a human ever picking up a camera. Within seconds, it returns a diagnosis and an actionable treatment recommendation on a live dashboard.

This was built as a semester project for **Programming for Artificial Intelligence** at **FAST NUCES, Islamabad**.

> 📄 The complete project write-up — including team work distribution and full technical detail — is summarized in this README. The original submitted report is also included at [`docs/PlantEye_Project_Report.docx`](docs/PlantEye_Project_Report.docx) for reference.

## ✨ Key Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🧭 | **Autonomous + Manual Navigation** | Drives itself using an obstacle-aware control loop, or can be remote-controlled over HTTP |
| 🔍 | **Real-Time Plant Detection** | YOLOv8n locates potted plants in the live video feed and tracks the largest one as a target |
| 📡 | **Wireless Image Streaming** | The ESP32-CAM streams JPEG frames to the base station over WiFi — no cables, no SD cards |
| 🧠 | **AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis** | A MobileNetV2-based TensorFlow Lite model classifies leaf images across **38 disease/health classes** |
| 💊 | **Instant Treatment Advice** | A built-in knowledge base maps every diagnosis to a practical, actionable treatment |
| 📊 | **Live Diagnostic Dashboard** | A "mission control" style OpenCV UI shows the camera feed, confidence bars, and recommended action |
| 🔁 | **Continuous Scanning** | Once one plant is diagnosed, the rover automatically resumes searching for the next |
| 🛡️ | **Obstacle Avoidance** | An ultrasonic sensor halts the rover before it collides with anything in its path |

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system is split into **two independent ESP32 modules** and a **laptop "brain"**, all communicating wirelessly over MQTT — this keeps heavy AI inference off the microcontrollers entirely.

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/system-architecture.png" width="70%" alt="PlantEye system architecture diagram" />
</div>

| Module | Responsibility | Hardware |
|---|---|---|
| **Navigation Unit** | Drives the motors, avoids obstacles, executes HTTP movement commands | ESP32 Dev Module, L298N driver, HC-SR04 |
| **Vision Unit** | Captures JPEG frames and streams them over MQTT in chunks | ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker) |
| **AI Base Station** | Runs YOLOv8n for plant detection + steering, then MobileNetV2 (TFLite) for disease classification | Laptop |

All wireless transport runs over **MQTT**, chosen specifically for its lightweight footprint and **Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees** — ensuring image chunks arrive complete and in order even over a flaky WiFi link.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Robot Movement** — The rover drives forward while the ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance to detect obstacles in its path.
2. **Plant Detection** — YOLOv8n scans incoming video frames for the `potted plant` class and locks onto the largest detected target.
3. **Auto-Steering** — The AI base station compares the target's position to the frame center and sends `forward` / `left` / `right` / `stop` commands to the navigation ESP32 over HTTP until the plant fills the frame.
4. **Image Capture** — Once aligned, the ESP32-CAM captures a high-resolution frame of the leaves.
5. **Wireless Transmission** — The frame is chunked and published over MQTT to the base station.
6. **AI Diagnosis** — The MobileNetV2 TFLite model classifies the leaf image against 38 known classes and returns the top-5 predictions with confidence scores.
7. **Results & Resume** — The dashboard displays the diagnosis, confidence breakdown, and a treatment recommendation pulled from the built-in knowledge base. The rover then resumes scanning for the next plant.

## 🔌 Circuit Design

Two ESP32 modules work side-by-side, sharing a **common ground** across all components to keep signals clean. The standard ESP32 owns motor control and obstacle sensing via the L298N driver; the ESP32-CAM runs independently and focuses purely on image capture and transmission, preventing power and timing conflicts between the camera and the motors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Flash the Firmware

You'll need the **Arduino IDE** with the ESP32 board package installed.

**Libraries required:**
| Sketch | Libraries |
|---|---|
| `esp32_cam_streamer.ino` | `WiFi.h`, `PubSubClient`, `esp_camera.h` (bundled with ESP32 core, AI-Thinker board) |
| `motor_controller.ino` | `WiFi.h`, `WebServer.h` |

**Before uploading**, open each `.ino` file and replace the placeholders:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
const char* mqtt_server = "192.168.1.100";   // your broker's local IP (esp32_cam_streamer.ino only)
```

> ⚠️ **Board settings for the camera module:** Board = *AI Thinker ESP32-CAM*, Partition Scheme = *Huge APP (3MB No OTA)*, and connect via a USB-to-serial adapter (GPIO0 → GND during flashing).

### 2. Set Up the AI Engine

Install **[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)** (or any MQTT broker) on the laptop that will run the AI engine, then:

```bash
cd ai-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update the robot's IP address in `mqtt_receiver.py`:

```python
ROBOT_IP = "192.168.1.101"   # the motor-controller ESP32's local IP
MQTT_BROKER = "localhost"    # or the broker's IP if running remotely
```

### 3. Run the System

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the MQTT-powered vision + autopilot loop
python mqtt_receiver.py

# Terminal 2 — start the disease diagnosis dashboard
python plant_doctor.py
```

**Controls inside `mqtt_receiver.py`:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `A` | Toggle autopilot (rover auto-tracks and approaches the nearest plant) |
| `C` | Capture the current frame for diagnosis |
| `Q` | Quit and stop the stream |

Captured frames automatically drop into `ai-engine/captured_images/`, which `plant_doctor.py` watches and diagnoses in real time.

## 📡 MQTT Topic Reference

| Topic | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `planteye/camera/stream` | ESP32-CAM → Base | Live JPEG frame chunks (`FRAME:size:chunks` → chunks → `FRAME_END`) |
| `planteye/camera/image` | ESP32-CAM → Base | High-res still capture chunks (`START:size:chunks` → chunks → `END`) |
| `planteye/camera/command` | Base → ESP32-CAM | `CAPTURE`, `START_STREAM`, `STOP_STREAM`, `FLASH_ON`, `FLASH_OFF` |
| `planteye/camera/status` | ESP32-CAM → Base | Online/offline status, retained Last-Will message |

---

## 🛠 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Hardware integration** — the camera and motors interfered with each other when sharing one controller | Split the system across **two independent ESP32 modules**, isolating imaging from motor control |
| **Disease detection accuracy** — thousands of diseases look visually similar | Used **MobileNetV2**, pre-trained on a large plant-disease dataset, for a strong classification baseline |
| **Limited onboard compute** — the ESP32 can't run deep learning models | Offloaded **all AI inference to the laptop**; the rover only captures and streams images |
| **Battery holder burnout** — a holder overheated under combined motor + camera current draw | Replaced it with a higher-quality, better heat-dissipating holder and added a dedicated voltage regulator |

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 📍 **GPS tracking** to map exactly where diseased plants were found
- 💧 **Soil moisture sensing** to distinguish disease from simple water/nutrient stress
- 📱 A **mobile app** to replace the laptop dependency entirely
- 🌍 An **expanded disease database** covering ornamentals, trees, and more crop species
